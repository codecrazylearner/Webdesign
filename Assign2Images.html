  <h4>
     <em><strong>NOTE:</strong></em> 
  </h4>   
  <p>I forgot to mention in How to prepate that you need to preheat the oven for 350 degrees for 10 minutes before preparing. &#128551;</p>
  <p>You can also add any grains like quinoa, brownrice or nuts or vegetables which can be turned as burgers as it is heavy but in this recipe I want lighter patties &#128516;</p> 
  <p>The patties can get very dry and hard on the outside if it is baked in a higher temperature.&#128542;The outside of the patties develops a caramelization and the inside will be soft.&#128528;</p>
  <p>Spinach taste will be more prominent as it is used in generous amounts. &#128541;The color of the patties are green but the amount of spinach can be reduced and replaced with meat,veggie,nuts or even grains.&#128526; </p>
